✅ This way, you don’t lose the *Next.js setup instructions*, but you elevate the README into a **flagship showcase** that makes your repo recruiter-friendly.  

Do you want me to also write you a **short “Repo Tagline” (under 80 chars)** you can put in the repo description field (above the README) so recruiters instantly know what it is *before* they click in?
